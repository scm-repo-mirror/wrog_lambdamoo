/* Experimenting

 * This module contains an example of how to add functionality to the
 * MOO server using interfaces exported by various other modules.  The
 * example itself is commented out, since it's really not all that
 * useful in general; it was written primarily to test out the
 * interfaces it uses.
 *
 * The uncommented parts of this module provide one possible skeleton
 * for a module that implements new MOO built-in functions.  Replacing
 * the commented-out parts is a quick way to try out your own function
 * definitions.  In future releases, this file will be kept as a
 * convenient place to experiment with new server functionality; it
 * will not contain any live code that the server actually depends on,
 * or, rather, nothing beyond the register_experiments() function with
 * its #ifdef-ed out body that *does*, in fact, get called on every
 * server startup even though it does nothing by default (i.e.,
 * assuming you leave it unmodified).
 */

/*\ Random explanatory meta-comments that do not need to appear
 *| in any Actual File will look like this.  Enjoy.  --wrog
 */

/*\ (Historical note:  This file *was* originally named extensions.c,
 *|  but has since been renamed to better reflect its role as a
 *|  playground now that (25 years later) there is a somewhat more
 *|  developed extension framework and with a bit more thought put
 *|  into how extensions should be defined, behave, and interact with
 *|  each other in the server context.  See Extensions.md for what you
 *|  need to know once you are ready to migrate code *out* of this
 *|  file and into an actual extension.)

/*\ 1st block of includes for a .c file answers this question:
 *| What interfaces are we exporting or contributing to?
 *|
 *| As per usual C practice, declare anything of use to other modules
 *| in experiments.h.  And usually there will just be one file here.
 *|
 *| However, because *this* file also defines a registration function
 *| (register_experiments()), and, as a matter of convention and unlike
 *| all other interfaces, the registration functions are all "owned" by
 *| the bf_register module (even though they do not actually live in
 *| bf_register.c; see explanation in bf_register.h), there will, in
 *| fact be a 2nd file to mention here:

 *| It is, however, pretty much guaranteed you'll eventually reference
 *| something from there, so you may as well put these in now and get
