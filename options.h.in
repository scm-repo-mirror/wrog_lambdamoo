    !!! WARNING:  If you are about to edit this file,  !!!
    !!! STOP.     READ THIS FIRST.                     !!!

options.h      is what gets compiled into the server.
options.h.in   is the template for options.h
so this same text inevitably has to appear in both places.

Know which file you're viewing.  options.h is read-only.

Historically, options.h was a file you were SUPPOSED to edit in order
to change option settings and much of the text is still written that
way.  You *could* still edit it if you want, but you probably don't.

(1) If you're seeing this comment in options.h.in
    because options.h does not yet exist,
    and you're a newbie wanting to learn more about options:

    You should run ./configure

    (no arguments or with --disable-unicode, whichever works.
    If neither of those work, this file won't help you.)

    ./configure generates an options.h file.
    It won't necessarily be the options.h you want,

    But *that* file will be more understandable than *this* file
    (which has baffling '#undef's everywhere For Reasons...)

    Once you understand the options you care about,
    you'll be able to run ./configure again with
    the right arguments to get the options.h you want.

(2) If you're seeing this comment in options.h
    and think you want to edit *this* file directly:

    Read "Using ./configure to set options" in README.md

    EDITS YOU MAKE HERE GET OVERWRITTEN whenever 'make' sees that
    options.h.in -- or any other file that this file indirectly
    depends on -- is changed (surprise).

    Now, if you're looking to do some kind of quick experiment and
    you're otherwise solely editing the C files---which this file does
    *not* depend on--and you DO NOT MIND that your edits here will
    eventually get overwritten when you're least expecting it, then

       chmod +w options.h ,  and proceed.

    Otherwise, you probably want to learn to use the
    ./configure arguments.  It will be easier.

    Also, ./configure -C is wickedly fast these days.

(3) If you're seeing this comment in options.h.in

    because you really do want to edit *this* file,
    which is a template (and you *can* edit because
    it's *not* read-only), and want to understand how it works,

    scroll down to the #endif and continue reading.

    !!!   (end of ominous warning text)
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*/

#ifndef Options_H
#define Options_H 1
/*
General notes:

(0) Options are named by C preprocessor names that this file will
    either #define to some value or leave #undef'ed.

(1) Be wary of option values marked "EXPERIMENTAL".

(2) When using #define here, *always* provide a value; i.e.,
    even if #define'd vs. #undef is all that matters, just do

       #define NAME 1

    That way, if somebody was sloppy (shouldn't happen, but it does)
    and used #if when they should have used #ifdef, you don't lose.

    (./configure takes care of this for you.)

(3) Some option values mean "I don't care" and get revised by
    options_epilog.h to some useful default.

    Sometimes the "I don't care" value is #undef,

    Sometimes the "I don't care" value is OPTION_DEFAULT,
    usually when #undef needs to mean, "I want this OFF(false)".

    Due to backwards compatibility needs, we're not always consistent
    about using OPTION_DEFAULT everywhere it would make sense to do so.

    Read the descriptions and/or look at options.ac to see
    if the default is 'no' or ''.

And now for the options:

Additional comments (there is no further code in this file):

If what you want is to change the default setting for an option:

    The best and easiest way to do this is to edit options.ac and rerun
    autoconf (and then please fix the help text to make it match up
    with whatever you did).

    Commentary in options.ac explains how options.ac works.

If what you want is to add an entirely new option:

    options.ac has guidelines for that.

options.h.in, being the template for options.h, is treated by
./configure in exactly the same way as config.h.in:

    When creating options.h, ./configure (config.status, actually)
    reads options.h.in and replaces each bare #undef line with either
    a #define or a comment, according to the command line arguments
    provided or the default values in options.ac.  All other text is
    copied verbatim.

If autoconf is not available and you really want to change an option
default instead of saving the ./configure command line you used
(./config.status --config):

    Changing an #undef in options.h.in to a #define will do what you'd
    expect on the next ./configure run.  But to make something here
    **stay** #undef'ed, you need to **comment out** the #undef so that
    ./config.status can't find it.

    (You might possibly instead prefer to put your changes at the
    beginning of options_epilog.h instead.  I wouldn't, but since
    these are changes that will never go back into the server
    distribution, you can do what you like.  The hard part will be
    remembering what you did 6 months from now.)
