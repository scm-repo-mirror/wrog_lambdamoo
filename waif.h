/* (original Ben comment from 1998-2002:)
 * Try to make struct Waif fit into 32 bytes with this mapsz.  These
 * bytes are probably "free" (from a powers-of-two allocator) and we
 * can use them to save lots of space.  With 64bit addresses I think
 * the right value is 8.  If checkpoints are unforked, save space for
 * an index used while saving.  Otherwise we can alias propdefs and
 * clobber it in the child.
 *
 * (wrog continues in 2024:)
 * Assumptions needed to make this comment work:
 *    (1) size here includes the hidden 4 byte (at-the-time) refcount,
 *    (2) the original 'unsigned long' type for pmap[] elements was
 *        intended to be 32 bits (not *entirely* certain since 'long'
 *        *is* a way to get 64 bit ints on some platforms),
 *        but the hardwired 32 in count_set_bits() gives the game away.
 *    (3) the target size in 64-bit land is 64 bytes
 *
 * at which point we get
 *            (4)+4+4+4+4+4*(WAIF_MAPSZ)==32 -> WAIF_MAPSZ=3
 * along with
 *            (4)+4+4+8+8+4*(WAIF_MAPSZ)==64 -> WAIF_MAPSZ=8
 * for the 64-bit-pointers/32-bit-everything-else world
 * which then makes the above comment work...
 *
 * ... but 2024 is a yet different world with likely-64-bit Objids/ints
 * and also the 'int' refcount *might* be 64 bits as well,

 * ... though even if it isn't, the two pointers preceding pmap likely
 * need to be aligned on 8-byte boundaries, at which point a 4-byte
 * refcount will then produce 4 bytes of padding, so we may as well
 * assume an 8-byte refcount in all cases, which then means
 *
 *            (8)+4+4+8+8+4*(WAIF_MAPSZ)==64 -> WAIF_MAPSZ=8
 *
 * for the INT_TYPE_BITSIZE=32 case (... 32 byte Waifs now being
 * impossible because there is no way to get 4-byte pointers on a
 * 64-bit architecture without invoking stupid memory models and I
 * imagine we *really* don't want to go there..) --- with the same
 * story for the INT_TYPE_BITSIZE=16 case, since even if that might
 * theoretically yield 4 more bytes of space from the Objid,
 * the padding daemons will probably take it away.
 *
 * Meanwhile we have
 *
 *            (8)+8+8+8+8+4*(WAIF_MAPSZ)==64 -> WAIF_MAPSZ=6
 *
 * for the INT_TYPE_BITSIZE=64 case.  6 (=6*32=192 property values) is
 * likely to be plenty anyway, so we *could* just make it 6 always.
 * ...  but I like the idea of preserving the !UNFORKED_CHECKPOINTS
 * code (i.e., having .save_index steal space from .pmap[]) just in
 * case space again becomes tight in the future for some reasons
 * (e.g., Waifs getting more slots, or Apocalyptic Wilderness...)
 *
 * However, I put in the struct/union .u to make the memory
 * overlap more obvious and *not* constrain us to a particular
 * type for .save_index should we want to widen it some day)
